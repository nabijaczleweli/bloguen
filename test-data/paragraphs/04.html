<p>Well ain't that just a breeze of a title? Anyway, hello and welcome to The Art of the Bodge, as inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/lIFE7h3m40U">an analogously named video</a> from <a href="https://youtube.com/tomscottgo">Tom Scott</a>, wherein I (and hopefully other people, I love seeing folks' DIYs/bodges) arrive at a dead-simple solution to a problem (and then pay the piper).<br />
Right, so with that in our think-cushions and a depressive episode out of the way, let's get crackin' on to the meat of this installment (for some definition of &quot;cracking on&quot;).</p>
<p>So, when father was digging through the basement looking for god-knows-what (he's the weirdest things), he called upon me when he ran into some speakers I requested be set aside at least three-four years prior when some old radio we'd had had given up the ghost.<br />
Now, the big part of the living room here is the distinct <em>lack</em> of any good speakers, with some garbage PC speakers in the stead, so, I thought, &quot;why not put those there&quot; (boring) and figure out the funky connectors (fun!).</p>

Fig. 1: both connectors, three out of four holes plugged, leftmost wire tinned.</p>
<p>The connectors are made of some kind of black plastic and pokey bits (we're all professionals here, right?) somewhere deep on the ID. Now, the holes looked weirdly close, size-wise, to some 2.5mmΒ² wire I'd purchased long prior (it's a surprisingly good structural material, striking a good spot between hand-workability and stiffness, be it for <a href="https://twitter.com/nabijaczleweli/status/980548125684305922">a reaxion flask</a> or hanging a welding mask on a garment rack).<br />
And, whaddayaknow, they fit! This means that the hole size is, roughly:</p>

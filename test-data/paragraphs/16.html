<p>Well ain't that just a breeze of a title? Anyway, hello and welcome to The Art of the Bodge, as inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/lIFE7h3m40U">an analogously named video</a> from <a href="https://youtube.com/tomscottgo">Tom Scott</a>, wherein I (and hopefully other people, I love seeing folks' DIYs/bodges) arrive at a dead-simple solution to a problem (and then pay the piper).<br />
Right, so with that in our think-cushions and a depressive episode out of the way, let's get crackin' on to the meat of this installment (for some definition of &quot;cracking on&quot;).</p>
<p>So, when father was digging through the basement looking for god-knows-what (he's the weirdest things), he called upon me when he ran into some speakers I requested be set aside at least three-four years prior when some old radio we'd had had given up the ghost.<br />
Now, the big part of the living room here is the distinct <em>lack</em> of any good speakers, with some garbage PC speakers in the stead, so, I thought, &quot;why not put those there&quot; (boring) and figure out the funky connectors (fun!).</p>
<p><img src="007.%202018-07-19%20monotinned%20top%20view%203.JPG" alt="Two speaker connectors made of black plastic, three out of the four holes plugged by wire, one wire inside tinned" /><br />
Fig. 1: both connectors, three out of four holes plugged, leftmost wire tinned.</p>
<p>The connectors are made of some kind of black plastic and pokey bits (we're all professionals here, right?) somewhere deep on the ID. Now, the holes looked weirdly close, size-wise, to some 2.5mmΒ² wire I'd purchased long prior (it's a surprisingly good structural material, striking a good spot between hand-workability and stiffness, be it for <a href="https://twitter.com/nabijaczleweli/status/980548125684305922">a reaxion flask</a> or hanging a welding mask on a garment rack).<br />
And, whaddayaknow, they fit! This means that the hole size is, roughly:</p>
<p><img src="007.%202018-07-28%20diameter%20formula.png" alt="Formula and result for the diameter, yielding roughly 1.784mm" /><br />
Fig. 2: formula for the wire diameter/hole side, yielding ca. 1.784mm.</p>
<p>Which also finally, with the speaker size, disproves my hunch that this would be an American product β€“ neither is 1.784mm reducible to a multiple of a binary fraxion of 2.54, nor do any dimensions (that is, 175 x 205 x 277.5), make any sense in an imperial reference frame.<br />
Anyway, the plan from now on was, <em>en thΓ©orie</em>, simple: tin the business end of the infit (already done on the leftmost one in Fig. 1) and solder two pairs of a ribbon cable to the two connectors.</p>
<p><img src="007.%202018-07-25%20quadsoldered%20closeup.JPG" alt="Same speaker connectors, but the wires are all tinned and with soldered ribbon strands, the tinned parts of the left wire pair are touching, the rightmost wire is not inserted" /><br />
Fig. 3: both connectors tinned &amp; with soldered wires, rightmost one left unplugged; note how the left pair is touching.</p>
<p>(It was <em>not</em> simple, though, because the whole bloody thing behaves like a huge heatsink and keeping it at temperature was a nightmare.)<br />
Now, there are two problems here: the clearly evident one is the short between the terminals on the left.<br />
That would've been solved by America's second-favourite libation: a heatshrink. However, it turns out I don't actually own heatshrinks this large (it's not every day that you heatshrink a 20A-rated cable), therefore it was necessary for me to turn back to the spawn of Satan itself β€“ electric tape.</p>
<p><img src="007.%202018-07-25%20eletaped%202.JPG" alt="Same speaker connectors still, but the parts of the wires previously tinned are wrapped in electric tape, whose colour matches that of the ribbon threads" /><br />
Fig. 4: all connectors wrapped in electric tape.</p>
<p>That was easy enough! After soaking out the filth that electric tape left on one's fingers (and, more importantly, their soul), the second problem can be tackled: the standard interface. Now, every end-user audio device has a 3.5mm audio jack, so that's definitely what will be used <em>Γ  la fin</em>, however, while hard-soldering one to the ribbon ends is definitely possible, it's unviable: not only does it define the speaker chirality (unsure what the professional audio term is) (not that it matters, though, despite however cold the joints might look, I measured the resistance and it's within tolerance), it's also prone to breaking, so the obvious solution and the second standard employed will be the electronics' gold- standard and pin.<br />
Au premiΓ¨re, though, tests were performed to see whether the TV can drive these massive speakers without external power (i.e. whether transistorbs were needed) and thankfully it could, so I managed to avoid designing an actual board for this, and instead I could just opt forβ€¦</p>
